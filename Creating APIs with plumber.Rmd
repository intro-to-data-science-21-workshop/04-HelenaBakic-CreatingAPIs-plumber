##What are APIs?

API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules on how computers or applications communicate with one another.

**Metaphor:** Electric sockets are interfaces to access a service -- a socket is an intermediary between electricity and a vacuum cleaner.<sup>1</sup>

**Everyday APIs:**
- web browsers 
- login with Google/Twitter/Facebook
- travel booking (e.g. Skyscanner)
- every time we see a Google map on a web site

##How do (web) APIs work?

1. A **client** initiates an API call (**request**) to retrieve information 
2. API "talks" to a web server
3. A **server** sends a **response** with the requested information
4. API transfers the data to the client

#Quick intro to APIs

##Why do we need them?

Electric sockets are useful because:
- any device can outsource its electrical requirements and always get the same output
- devices can easily be moved around
- devices do not care about the changes behind the socket as long as the output remains the same
- electricity service does not care about the device

APIs are useful because:
- code/data can be easily shared and re/used
- information can be shared across multiple clients and will not depend on the programming language

#The Plumber package

.pull-left[

The `plumber` R package allows users to expose existing R code as a web service available to others by using simple "annotations".

How to work with `plumber`:
0. Write the code you want to share
1. Annotate (**decorate**) your code with special comments (#*) and tags (@)
2. Run (**plumb**) the API
3. (Deploy your API)

Incoming requests pass through a set of mechanisms before a response is returned to a client:

1. `@filter [name]` can forward requests, throw errors, or return a response without forwarding the request
2. `@parser [parser name]` determines how Plumber parses the request body (default: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON))
3. endpoint (e.g.`@get`) responds to incoming requests that match the defined method
4. `@serializer [serializer name]` determines the format of the response (default JSON)
