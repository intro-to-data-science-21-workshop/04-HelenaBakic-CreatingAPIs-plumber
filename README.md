# Web APIs with plumber


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to working with web APIs in R using the plumber package. At its core, APIs are built around a request and a response.At one end, a client makes a request to a server, this request gets processed and a response is provided to the client. Plumber uses special comments to turn any arbitrary R code into API endpoints, this means R users can create APIs for clients without requiring the end user to have any R knowledge. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) introduce the plumber package to you, (2) get a feel for the type of possibilities the plumber package offers, and (3) provide you with exercises and solutions to practice your plumbing. References to other useful plumber resources are also available.
